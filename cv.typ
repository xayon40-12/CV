  = About me
  Pationate about programming languages from the common Java, through the esoteric Haskell, to the recents Rust. Strong interest to Type Theory and proof languages.

  Adept at type level programming and optimization, I appreciate challenging programming tasks.
  
  = Interests
  - Homotopy Type Theory
  - Japanese Language
  - Physical simulations
  - Physics and graphics engines
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Fantasy novels/comics/cartoon
  - Board games
