#entry(
  title: "Full stack Rust developper",
  date: "2024 â€“ 2025",
  institution: "LetScan",
  location: "Nantes, France",
)[
  Technical leader of a team of 3 developpers dedicated to efficient signal processing.
  - Developpement of a CPU and GPU backend for efficient signal processing.
  - Creation and implementation of a compute server, a web client, and a native app connected by encrypted connections to analyse and synthesise signals.
  - Creation of a mobile app dedicated to the classification of baby emotions. For this purpose, an AI model was trained on the output of the signal analysis method developped by the company.
